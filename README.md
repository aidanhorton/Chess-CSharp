# Chess-CSharp
Lightweight chess engine with AI

WIP, currently in the prototyping stage

Todo list:
- FEN log https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation
- Castling
- En passon
- Don't fallback to castle move if no threat or no good path
- Check/Checkmate logging
- Stalemate logging
- Game can be played any orientation, any colour
- Multi-threading
- GetAllMoves for a piece returns an enumeration to allow alpha-beta pruning to happen faster
